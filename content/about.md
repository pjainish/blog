I spend my days building AI systems that actually make people's lives better. There's something deeply satisfying about watching a recommendation engine help someone discover their new favorite book, or seeing a computer vision system solve a problem that used to take hours of manual work.

Currently, I'm a Lead Applied Engineer, but I also love working with folks who have interesting problems they want to solve with AI. Whether it's recommendation systems, computer vision magic, or making sense of messy data with machine learning – I'm probably already sketching solutions in my head.

## The Fun Stuff I Work On

I've been tinkering with everything from signal processing to biometrics, but these days I'm really excited about:

- Building recommendation systems that feels like a usual barkeep
- Computer vision projects that make you go "wait, how did it know that?"
- NLP applications that understand what people actually mean
- Getting ML models to behave nicely in the real world
- Exploring how AI can make education and entertainment more engaging

## Beyond the Code

What really gets me going is helping businesses figure out how to use all this cool technology in ways that actually matter. Sometimes that means rethinking how they operate, sometimes it's about finding opportunities they didn't know existed. 

I've helped companies:
- Turn their data into something that drives real decisions
- Build products that customers didn't know they needed (but absolutely love)
- Navigate the whole "should we build this AI thing?" question
- Transform old-school industries with some clever tech applications

## Working Together

I genuinely enjoy the puzzle of matching the right technology to the right problem. If you're working on something interesting – whether it's a startup idea that keeps you up at night or an established business looking to do something new – I'd love to hear about it.

The best projects happen when smart people get together and start asking "what if we tried...?" 

## When I'm Not Building AI Things

You'll probably find me on a climbing a rock, out for a coffee, or enjoying classic cinema. But honestly, my curiosity doesn't take much of a break – I love diving into cognitive science, computational neuroscience, physics, and psychology. There's something beautiful about how these fields connect to what we're doing in AI.

At my core, I'm just someone who's endlessly curious about how everything works – from neural networks to actual neurons, from algorithms to the physics that makes it all possible. It all feeds back into better solutions somehow.
